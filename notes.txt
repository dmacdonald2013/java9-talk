* Java 9
- Java Enhancement Proposals (JEP)
- 6 included as part of roadmap

* Modules
- Refactor the JDK source code into modules (but not binaries)
- Project Jigsaw Lite
- Mailing lists indicates this has been completed
- Static modularity, not trying to achieve OSGi-style loading
- Goals: scalable, security, JAR hell

* JSON API
- Ability to consume and produce 
- Streaming JSON with events

* Process API
- more control over process trees (get pid back, etc.)
- improves on java7s ability to redirect process streams
- Windows likely cause of issues here
